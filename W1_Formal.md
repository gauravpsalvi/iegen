Template - However, Similarly, Although

Dear Sir or Madam.

//Para 1 - describe yourself and why  you are writing
My name is Rebecca Moses Dmello and I live in woodstock. I have been using your __
(services and buying your products) for the last 11 years and had a very pleasant experience so far.
- I am writing to let you know that I am unhappy with my ___. 
while the __(accomodation/packaging) itself is fine, my __(housemate/TV) has become intolerable/faulty 
making it almost impossible for me to _(use/work). I hope you will consider my situation favourably.

- I am writing to bring to your attention an incident that occured in your supermarket last weekend.
I would also like to make some suggestions so that such a thing does not happen again.

My name is Rebecca and I have been a loyal customer at Walmart ever since I moved into the new westminster area 8 years ago.
Altough your store is sligtly further from my house than the 7 elevan, I have always made the trip because of your quality 
fresh produce and excellent customer service.

On this occasion, however, I suffered an unfortunate accident due, I believe, to the negligence of the shop floor staff.
As I was walking to the checkout with my groceries, I slipped on some spilled water and fell over, spraining my wrist in the process.

Though I understand the store gets very busy, I feel that this fall could have been avoided if the staff had been quicker to act. 
I would therefore like to suggest that you review your policies around spillages, and , in particular, ensure that staff menbers stand
guard next to any spilled liquids until they have been cleaned up.

//Para 2 - describe your situation/problem
Let me explain my situation. The trouble started about __ months ago when _. Prior to that, everything was fine; 
my old _ was extremely considerate. My current _, however, __(noisy/blurry). As such, I have genuinely not been able
to sleep and therefore cannot concentrate on my work.

//Customer Service example
On Tuesday, 12th June, I visited your store to purchase a TV. I bought a Toshiba LED TV which has the code 40L675B40.
On purchasing this TV, I was assured that this was the latest model and the best there was to buy. However, when I got home
I discovered that not only did the remote controls not work but also the quality of the picture was not as good as promised,
in fact it was quite blurry. I called your customer service department immediately on Tuesday and they assured me that the TV 
would be replaced or fixed within two days. I am disappointed to say that this has not happened and I have received no 
communication since then.

//Para 3 - Provide the solution and conclude
I am exceedingly displeased with both the quality of the product I purchased from your company as well as the poor customer
service I have received since. I hope this problem will be resolved promptly. I expect to receive a replacement TV or have a
refund immediately.

//I look forward to hearing back from you immediately.
//Looking forward to a positive reply.
//Thank you for your consideration.
//I appreciate your assistance in this matter
//I hope you will take this into account in order to avoid further mishaps

//Yours faithfully,
//Rebecca
