Dear Mr. Smith,

I am writing to ask for an unpaid leave for two weeks. Unfortunately, my sister had a car crash in Thailand and she needs a kidney donor and 
since I am her closest relative I might be the only one who could save her.

I would like to fly out as soon as possible, as her condition is getting worse very fast according to doctor Liu's phone call. 
I have already booked the first available flight to Asia and the return tickets as well. Therefore, the exact period of time of my absence would be two weeks
starting from the 21st of January. I will arrive back in the UK in the early morning of the 7th of February and I would be able to start working the same day.

Since my colleagues Mr White and Mr Black both have a full overview of my duties, they could very well do my work during the abovementioned weeks.
However, I could be contacted should anything urgent arise.

Please consider this extreme situation I am facing at the moment and allow me to have this time off work.

Yours Faithfully,
xyz
