and the weather is very nice. Last year I visited greece during spring and had enjoyed the cherry blossom everywhere

bcz it's fast and convenient

Ok, that's a tough question, bcz there are tons of places I would like to go to, but if I get to choose  to go anywhere, I think I would 
go to Antractica. It's remote and difficult to access but I heard it's very beautiful, and snow and ice are rare sights for me.
