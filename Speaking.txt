Part 1 - Basic questions about personal self
1. What do you do for fun
For entertainment, I like to socialize, and meet my friends. 
Last night, I had a great conversation over dinner with Alex

2. Who do you like to spend your time with?
I like to spend my free time withmy family and friends, I feel comfortable around them, and I can be myself

3. How often do you travel?
Before the pandemic, I used to go outside of Vancouver atleast one a quater, either to visit relatives or friends in toronto
or just for sightseeing over there, but nowadays I'm mostly staying local

4. Where do you like to visit?
I like exploring new cultures, and seeing the diversity of new places. Last year I was in Australia, and it was a unique and beautiful place 

5. When is the best time to travel for you?
I think the best time to travel is during summer or spring, I get time off from school,
and the weather is very nice. Last year I visited greece during spring and had enjoyed the cherry blossom everywhere

6.What is your favorite way to travel?
I like traveling by car when going locally, it's comfortable, I can put music. If the destination is located far away, then I like to take the airplane,
bcz it's fast and convenient

7. Have you ever travelled to other places?
Yes, as I said I've been to Greece, I've also been around Europe and some places in Australia and middle east.
I am fortunate bcz, since I was a child my family goes abroad atleast once a year. Both my parents love to travel and explore places

8. If you could visit any place on earth, where would you go?
Ok, that's a tough question, bcz there are tons of places I would like to go to, but if I get to choose  to go anywhere, I think I would 
go to Antractica. It's remote and difficult to access but I heard it's very beautiful, and snow and ice are rare sights for me.

PART 2- card question (Brief - 2 minutes)
Talk about an important choice that you had to make in your life
1. When did you make this choice
2. What did you have to choose between?
3. Did you make a good choice or not?
4. How did you feel when you were making the choice?

=> Yes, definitely the most important choice that I have to make in my life, is to choose where to go for
my post-secondary education, I mean University.
I had to choose between studying in my home country, India, in Mumbai university, or to go to Choose a School in Canada.
So both decisions have their advantages and disadvantages.
If I had to choose mumbai university I would be close to my momdad, and close to my friends and family. Life would also
be cheaper, since I would not have to rent or bear any additional costs and would definately be able to fit in with the
school clture since I'm a local. However, if I choose to study in canada, that would mean that it would cost much more money 
along with culture shock and being homesickness. I would also learn new culture and make new connections in canada while having a better life
which would be very valuable for me.
While taking this decision, I was both nervous and excited bcz it would have a deciding factor on my future
