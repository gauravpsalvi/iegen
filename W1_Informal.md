Q
LAst month you has an overseas holiday with some friends where you stayed at their house.
They have just sent you some holiday photos.

Write a letter to your friends. In you letter:
- thank them for the holiday and the photos
- explain why you didn't write earlier
- invite them to come and stay with you

Hi John and Laura,

How are you both? I hope this letter finds you well. Although it's such a short time since we last saw each other, 
it feels much longer.

Thank you so much not only for such a memorable holiday but also for the lovely photos that you sent of our holiday together. 
It brought it all back  to me so vividly. Staying with you and seeing where you live was a real eye-opener for me. 
Australia is cerainly a scenic country with remarkable landscape and wildlife, particularly up in the north where you are.

I know I should've written to you sooner but I've been very busy with work and trying to catch up on assignments that were
left pending before my trip. Also, my youngest son John, is transferring to a new school after receiving a full scholarship from
the Lockwood private Institute. I am very proud of him but I've been running around trying to complete his transfer in time for the 
new school year since his father's been on a business trip for the past couple of weeks.

Next month, we'll be celebrating our Weding Anniversary and we'd be delighted if you could come over to celebrate it with us. 
It'be a chance for your to meet the rest of the family and see a bit of England. Of course, you must stay with us.
There's plenty of room and we'll pick you up at the airport. I really hope you can make it.

Take care and write back soon.

Rebecca
