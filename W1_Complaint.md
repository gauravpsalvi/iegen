Q-
You bought a TV a week ago but when you got home you discovered it did not work properly. 
You called customer service to report the problem but you have not received any help.

Write a letter to the company and in your letter:
- inytroduce yourself
- explain the problem
- and state what action you would like from the company


Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing this letter to report the faulty TV that I purchased from your company on Tuesday last week.

My name is Rebecca Moses Dmello and I am one of your frequent customers. I live in woodstock and have been using 
your services and buying your products for the last 11 years.

On Tuesday, 12th June, I visited your store to purchase a TV. I bought a Toshiba LED TV which has the code
40L675B40. On purchasing this TV, I was assured that this was the latest model and the best there was to buy.
However, when I got home I discovered that not only did the remote controls wasn't working but also 
the quality of the picture was not as good as promised, in fact it was quite blurry. I called your customer
service department immediately on Tueday and they assured me that my TV would be replaced or fixed within two days. 
I am disappointed to say that this has not happened and I have received no communication since then.

I am exceedingly displeased with both the quality of the product I purchased from your company as well as the 
poor service I have received since. I hope this problem will be resolved promptly. I expect to receive a 
replacement TV or have my current TV repaired but only if it could be fixed within a day.

I look forward to hearing back from you immediately.

Your faithfully,

Miss R M Dmello

Q - College student complaining about accomodation
-> describe the situation
-> explain your problems and why it is diificult to work
-> say what kind of accomodation you would prefer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to let you know that I am unhappy with my current living conditions. While the accommodation itself is fine,
my housemate has become intolerable making it almost impossible for me to work. I hope you will consider my situation favourably.

Let me explain my situation. The trouble started about three months ago when my housemate first moved in. 
Prior to that, everything was fine; my old housemate was extremely considerate. My current housemate, however, 
stays up almost all night and plays incessantly loud music. As such, I have not been able to sleeep properly and therefore
cannot concentrate on my studies.

Would you kindly transfer me or my housemate to another room? I would much prefer to live with someone who is quiter and 
more considerate of others. As long as it is quiet, I don't mind whom I live with.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,
Rebecca

Alternative Statements
- Last week I bought a TV from your store but from the very first day it did not work properly.
- I have called the customer service department several times but I was either put on hold for over 30 minutes or they put 
  the phone down on me. This is completely unacceptable.
- I requested that the store manager find a solution for the TV and he told me that he would send a technician to fix the problem.
  However, he failed to do this and I have been waiting for over one week now with no positive outcome.
- I am exceedingly disappointed with the customer services that your company provides.
- I expect someone from your company to fix this problem or replace the current TV within one to two days.
