Q-
You bought a TV a week ago but when you got home you discovered it did not work properly. 
You called customer service to report the problem but you have not received any help.

Write a letter to the company and in your letter:
- inytroduce yourself
- explain the problem
- and state what action you would like from the company


Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing this letter to report the faulty TV that I purchased from your company on Tuesday last week.

My name is Rebecca Moses Dmello and I am one of your frequent customers. I live in woodstock and have been using 
your services and buying your products for the last 11 years.

On Tuesday, 12th June, I visited your store to purchase a TV. I bought a Toshiba LED TV which has the code
40L675B40. On purchasing this TV, I was assured that this was the latest model and the best there was to buy.
However, when I got home I discovered that not only did the remote controls wasn't working but also 
the quality of the picture was not as good as promised, in fact it was quite blurry. I called your customer
service department immediately on Tueday and they assured me that my TVwould be replaced or fixed within two days. 
I am disappointed to say that this has not happened and I have received no communication since then.

I am exceedingly displeased with both the quality of the product I purchased from your company as well as the 
poor service I have received since. I hope this problem will be resolved promptly. I expect to receive a 
replacement TV or have my current TV repaired but only if it could be fixed within a day.

I look forward to hearing back from you immediately.

Your faithfully,

Miss R M Dmello
