Dear Sir,

I am writing to you regarding the recent article you published about Sir David Markham last week, April 2nd, in the Times newspaper.

The article gives a brief biography of Sir David's life and then continues to focus on his work and the impact it has had. The biography starts with his birth in Edinburgh and his later move in 1962 to Durham University. From there, it focuses on his work with the UN.

I would like to point out an error in your article. Documentation shows that Sir David did not go directly from Edinburgh to the University of Durham, in 1961. In fact he took a gap year in Europe working with a volunteer program and then went to University in 1962. I know this as I worked with a volunteer program and then went to University in 1962. I know this as I worked with him in Europe and become friends with him. His year abroad, which is absent from our article, created the foundation of his philosophy of life which guided him through his work in last years.

I hope you will publish this correction in the newspaper. Sir David's work is still of immense importance and people should know the importance of that gap year 
in his life.

Looking forward to a positive reply.

Yours sincerely,
Rebecca Moses Dmello
