Art-
"Art is a pictorial or material representation of cultural values". In a very simple sense, art is a composition of colors 
and shaped to create an image. Art can be used as a form of communication, expressing the artist's emotions or thoughts.
Throughout history, people were able to connect with art and use it as a form of escapism from their everyday lives. It also 
became a way for artists to immortalize themselves after they pass away by leaving behind artwork that represents their feelings
and aspirations when they were alive.
