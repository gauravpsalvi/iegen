Art-
"Art is a pictorial or material representation of cultural values". In a very simple sense, art is a composition of colors 
and shaped to create an image. Art can be used as a form of communication, expressing the artist's emotions or thoughts.
Throughout history, people were able to connect with art and use it as a form of escapism from their everyday lives. It also 
became a way for artists to immortalize themselves after they pass away by leaving behind artwork that represents their feelings
and aspirations when they were alive. Artwork keeps on changing constantly throughout time and always try to push boundaries 
and express new ideas and thoughts.
