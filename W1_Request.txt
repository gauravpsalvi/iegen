Dear sir or madam,

I have recently read about the __ Course on the xyz website that your institute uses and  I have a few questions.

As I am an __ speaker in French and have read that the course "B1" is offered for this level, I would like to know what this course comprises,
so that I will be able to decide whether this matches my abilities or whether I would need to signn up for another course. Additionally, I would
also like to know if the teacher providing the lessons are qualified native speakers, as I believe this is very important in order to get an 
authentic insight into the cultural context of the language studied. A native teacher has the greatest knowledge and understanding possible
of the language he or she is teaching.

Lastly, I would like to request if you could provide me a brochure of the different __(courses/menus) offered at your institution/restaurant,
using the address I have sent this letter from as the recipient address.

I look forward to your response.

Yours sincerely,
XYZ
