Dear sir or madam,

I have recently read about the __ Course on the companies official website that your institute uses and  I have a few questions. 
The intent of writing this letter is to seek for a complete itinerary of the course/menu.

(First of all, additionally and Lastly)
Firstly, As I am an __ speaker in French and have read that the course "B1" is offered for this level, I would like to know what this course__ comprises,
so that I will be able to decide whether this matches my abilities or whether I would need to sign up for another course. I wonder if you could also disclose 
the prices associated with each extra menu/course. Additionally, I would also like to know if the teacher/chef__ providing the lessons are qualified native speakers, as I believe this is very important in order to get an authentic insight into the cultural context of the language__ studied. 
Lastly,

I would appreciate if you could provide me a brochure of the different __(courses/menus) offered at your institution/restaurant. You could obtain my address from the recipient section used to sent this letter. I would also like to receive it as soon as possible but not later than a week due to my flight.

I look forward to receiving a prompt reply!

Yours sincerely,
XYZ
